# For a 30-second epoch at 25 fps, there are 750 frames.
# To extract 16 frames uniformly, set the extraction fps to 16/30 â‰ˆ 0.5333 fps.
extraction_fps = 16 / 30  # approximately 0.5333

# Crop/Perspective parameters:
# We assume your crop file gave you the following correct order of corners:
# Top-left: (620, 75)
# Top-right: (800, 100)
# Bottom-right: (550, 550)
# Bottom-left: (250, 350)
# And you want to map these to a 224x224 rectangle:
#   Out TL: (0,0), Out TR: (224,0), Out BR: (224,224), Out BL: (0,224)
# The ffmpeg perspective filter expects:
#   perspective=in_x0:in_y0:in_x1:in_y1:in_x2:in_y2:in_x3:in_y3:out_x0:out_y0:out_x1:out_y1:out_x2:out_y2:out_x3:out_y3:eval=init
# So the filter string should be:
perspective_filter = "620:75:800:100:550:550:250:350:0:0:224:0:224:224:0:224:eval=init"
